# 🚀 Utility Scripts & Project Skeletons

Welcome to my collection of utility scripts and project starter templates! This repository serves two main purposes:

1. 🛠️ **Utility Scripts**: Finished, polished scripts that are helpful for my own work or for others in their day-to-day tasks. These cover a range of topics and technologies.

2. 🏗️ **Project Skeletons**: Scripts to generate starter project structures for various types of projects (front-end, back-end, storage, etc.). These provide a solid foundation to build and iterate upon.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `powershell-utility-scripts/`: Contains standalone utility scripts, organized by topic or technology.
- `project-setup/`: Contains scripts to generate project starter templates.

Each script or skeleton will have its own dedicated directory with a README explaining its purpose and usage.
